                <p> <strong> Dragon Ball Z (Japanese: ドラゴンボールZ, Hepburn: Doragon Bōru Zetto, commonly abbreviated as
                        DBZ) is
                        a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation. It is the sequel to Dragon Ball
                        and adapts the latter 325 chapters of the original 519-chapter Dragon Ball manga series created
                        by Akira Toriyama which ran in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1988 to 1995. Dragon Ball Z aired in
                        Japan on Fuji
                        TV from April 1989 to January 1996, before getting subtitled or dubbed in territories including
                        the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, Asia, India and Latin America. It was broadcast in
                        at least 81 countries worldwide.[4] It is part of the Dragon Ball media franchise.

                        Dragon Ball Z continues the adventures of Son Goku, who, along with his companions, defend the
                        Earth against villains ranging from aliens (Vegeta, Frieza), androids (Cell) and magical
                        creatures (Majin Buu).
                        While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku from childhood to early adulthood, Dragon
                        Ball Z is a continuation of his adult life, but at the same time parallels the life of his son,
                        Gohan, as well as the development of his rivals, Piccolo and Vegeta. Due to the success of the
                        anime in the United States, the manga chapters making up its story were initially released by
                        Viz Media under the Dragon Ball Z title. Dragon Ball Z's popularity has spawned numerous
                        releases which have come to represent the majority of content in the Dragon Ball franchise;
                        including 16 movies,2 TV specials, and 148 video games (many of them being only released in
                        Japan), and a host of soundtracks stemming from this material. Dragon Ball Z remains a cultural
                        icon through numerous adaptations and re-releases, including a more-recent remastered broadcast
                        titled Dragon Ball Kai. The series has been received up to 35.4 billion views and was
                        influential on
                        its successors. [a] There have also been two sequel series, Dragon Ball GT (1996–1997) and
                        Dragon Ball Super (2015–2018).

                    Saiyan Saga
                    <br>
                    Dragon Ball Z picks up five years after the end of the Dragon Ball anime, with Goku now a young
                    adult and father to his son, Gohan.
                    <br>
                    A humanoid alien named Raditz arrives on Earth in a spacecraft and tracks down Goku, revealing to
                    him that he is his long-lost older brother and that they are members of a near-extinct alien warrior
                    race called the Saiyans (サイヤ人, Saiya-jin). The Saiyans had sent Goku (originally named "Kakarot") to
                    Earth as an infant to conquer the planet for them, but he suffered a severe blow to the head shortly
                    after his arrival and lost all memory of his mission, as well as his bloodthirsty Saiyan nature.
                    <br>
                    Raditz along with two elites, Vegeta and Nappa are the only remaining Saiyan warriors, so Raditz
                    comes to enlist Goku's help in conquering frontier worlds. When Goku refuses to join them, Raditz
                    takes Goku and Krillin down with one strike, kidnaps Gohan and threatens to murder him if Goku
                    doesn't kill 100 humans within the next 24 hours. Goku decides to team up with his arch-enemy
                    Piccolo, who was also defeated by Raditz in an earlier encounter, in order to defeat him and save
                    his son. During the battle, Gohan's rage momentarily makes him stronger than Piccolo and Goku as he
                    attacks Raditz to protect his father. The battle ends with Goku restraining Raditz so that Piccolo
                    can hit them with a deadly move called Special Beam Cannon, mortally wounding them both. Before
                    Raditz succumbs to his injuries, he reveals to Piccolo that the other two Saiyans are much stronger
                    than him and will come for the Dragon Balls in one year's time.
                    <br>
                    Having witnessed Gohan's latent potential, Piccolo takes him into the wilderness to train for the
                    upcoming battle against the Saiyan Elites. In the afterlife, Goku travels the million-kilometer
                    Snake Way so that he can train under the ruler of the North Galaxy, King Kai. King Kai teaches him
                    the Kaio-ken (界王拳) and Spirit Bomb (Genki Dama (元気玉)) techniques. In spite of his gruff nature,
                    Piccolo grows fond of Gohan while he oversees him learning to fend for himself. This forges an
                    unlikely emotional bond between the two.
                    <br>
                    After a year, Goku is revived with the Dragon Balls, but King Kai panics as he realizes that Goku
                    will have to take Snake Way again to get back and won't make it until hours after the Saiyans
                    arrive. Goku's allies group up to fight until Goku gets back, but prove to be no match for Nappa and
                    the "Prince of All Saiyans", Vegeta. Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu and Piccolo all perish in the
                    battle, with Piccolo's death causing both Kami and the Dragon Balls to fade from existence. When
                    Goku finally arrives at the battlefield, he avenges his fallen friends by easily defeating Nappa
                    before crippling him by breaking his spine in half. A furious Vegeta then executes Nappa for his
                    failure to kill Goku.
                    <br>
                    Goku uses several grades of the Kaio-ken to win the first clash with Vegeta, which concludes with a
                    climactic ki beam struggle, but it comes at a great cost to his body. Vegeta comes back and creates
                    an artificial moon to transform into a Great Ape, which he uses to torture Goku. Krillin and Gohan
                    sense that Goku is in trouble, and they return for a group fight with the now-seemingly unstoppable
                    Vegeta. They are aided at key moments by Yajirobe, who cuts Vegeta's tail to revert him into his
                    normal state. Goku gives Krillin a Spirit Bomb that he made, and Krillin uses it to severely damage
                    Vegeta. Vegeta is ultimately defeated when he is crushed by Gohan's Great Ape form, and he retreats
                    to his spaceship as Krillin approaches to finish him off. Goku convinces Krillin to spare Vegeta's
                    life and allow him to escape Earth, with Vegeta vowing to return and destroy the planet in revenge
                    for his humiliation at Goku's hands.
                    <br>
                    During the battle, Krillin overhears Vegeta mentioning the original set of Dragon Balls from
                    Piccolo's home world, Namek (ナメック星, Namekku-sei). While Goku recovers from his injuries, Gohan,
                    Krillin and Goku's oldest friend Bulma depart for Namek in order to use these Dragon Balls to revive
                    their fallen friends.
                <p>
                    Frieza Saga
                    <br>
                    Upon their arrival on Namek, Krillin, Gohan, and Bulma discover that Vegeta and his superior, the
                    galactic tyrant Frieza, are already there, each looking to use the Dragon Balls to obtain
                    immortality. Vegeta is stronger than before, as Saiyans become stronger when they recover from the
                    brink of death, so he seizes the opportunity to rebel against Frieza. A triangular game of
                    cat-and-mouse ensues, with Frieza, Vegeta and Gohan/Krillin alternately possessing one or more of
                    the Dragon Balls, with no one managing to possess all seven at any given time.
                    <br>
                    Vegeta manages to isolate Frieza's lieutenants one-by-one and kill them. When Frieza sees that
                    Vegeta is posing too big of a problem, he summons the Ginyu Force, a team of elite mercenaries led
                    by Captain Ginyu, who has the ability to switch bodies with his opponents. Vegeta reluctantly teams
                    up with Gohan and Krillin to fight them, knowing that they are too much for him to handle alone. The
                    Ginyu Force proves too powerful, but Goku finally arrives and defeats them single-handedly, saving
                    Vegeta, Gohan, and Krillin. Vegeta believes Goku may have become the legendary warrior of the
                    Saiyans, the Super Saiyan (超サイヤ人, Sūpā Saiya-jin). As Goku heals from a brutal fight with Captain
                    Ginyu, Krillin, Dende and Gohan secretly use the Dragon Balls behind Vegeta's back to wish for
                    Piccolo's resurrection and teleport him to Namek. Vegeta finds them using the Dragon Balls without
                    him, but the Grand Elder dies and renders the Dragon Balls inert before he can wish for immortality.
                    Just as this happens, Frieza arrives and decides to kill the four of them for denying him his wish
                    for immortality.
                    <br>
                    Piccolo arrives on Namek, but is accidentally separated from the others due to a badly-worded wish.
                    He finds the strongest Namekian warrior, Nail, who was defeated by Frieza, and fuses with him to
                    greatly increase his power.
                    <br>
                    Despite both Piccolo and Vegeta's advances in power, they are greatly outclassed by Frieza, who goes
                    through several transformations before reaching his final form, which he then uses to kill Dende.
                    <br>
                    Goku arrives after healing from his injuries, and Vegeta tells him that Frieza was the one who
                    destroyed the Saiyan homeworld and massacred the Saiyan race, as he feared that he would one day be
                    overthrown by a Super Saiyan. Frieza then kills Vegeta in front of Goku.
                    <br>
                    Though Goku's power exceeds Vegeta's, he is still no match for Frieza. Goku uses his last resort, a
                    massive Spirit Bomb with the energy of Namek and the surrounding worlds, and it seemingly defeats
                    the tyrant. However, Frieza manages to survive, and he unleashes his wrath upon the group by gravely
                    wounding Piccolo and murdering Krillin. Goku's rage finally erupts, and he undergoes a strange
                    transformation that turns his hair blond, his eyes blue and causes a golden aura to radiate from his
                    body. Goku has finally become a Super Saiyan.
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile, the revived Kami uses Earth's Dragon Balls to resurrect everyone on Namek that was killed
                    by Frieza and his henchmen, which also allows the Grand Elder to be resurrected for a short time,
                    and the Namekian Dragon to return. Dende uses the final wish to teleport everyone on Namek to Earth
                    except for Goku and Frieza.
                    <br>
                    Even at 100% power, Frieza proves to be no match for the Super Saiyan transformation, and Goku
                    defeats the evil tyrant before escaping Namek as the planet is destroyed in a massive explosion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Androids/Cell Saga
                    <br>
                    One year later, Frieza is revealed to have survived and arrives on Earth with his father, King Cold,
                    seeking revenge. However, a mysterious young man named Trunks appears, transforms into a Super
                    Saiyan and kills them both. Goku returns a few hours later, having spent the past year on the alien
                    planet Yardrat learning a new technique: Instant Transmission, which allows him to teleport to any
                    location he desires. Trunks reveals privately to Goku that he is the son of Vegeta and Bulma, and
                    has traveled from 17 years in the future to warn Goku that two Androids (人造人間, Jinzōningen, lit.
                    "Artificial Humans") created by Dr. Gero will appear in three years to seek revenge against Goku for
                    destroying the Red Ribbon Army when he was a child. Trunks says all of Goku's friends will fall to
                    them - while Goku himself will die from a heart virus six months prior to their arrival.
                    <br>
                    Trunks gives Goku medicine from the future that will save him from the heart virus and departs back
                    to his own time. When the androids arrive, Goku falls ill during his fight with Android 19, but is
                    saved by Vegeta, who reveals that he has also achieved the Super Saiyan transformation. Vegeta and
                    Piccolo easily defeat Android 19 and Dr. Gero (who turned himself into "Android 20"), but Trunks
                    returns from the future to check on their progress and reveals that the androids they defeated are
                    not the ones that killed all of them in the future.
                    <br>
                    With Goku out of commission and his allies overwhelmed by the arrival of Android 17 and 18, an evil
                    bio-Android called Cell emerges from a different timeline and embarks on a quest to find and absorb
                    Androids 17 and 18 which will allow him to attain his "perfect form".
                    <br>
                    Cell successfully absorbs Android 17, becoming considerably more powerful, but Vegeta returns to the
                    battle, having greatly elevated his own power, and easily overpowers him. However, Vegeta allows
                    Cell to absorb Android 18, believing that his "perfect form" will be no match for his Super Saiyan
                    power. Vegeta is subsequently defeated, with Cell sarcastically thanking him for helping him achieve
                    perfection.
                    <br>
                    Cell allows everyone to live for the time being and announces his own fighting tournament to decide
                    the fate of the Earth, known as the "Cell Games". Goku, recovered from the heart virus and having
                    reached the zenith of the Super Saiyan form, takes on Cell at the tournament. Goku eventually
                    realizes that Cell is far too powerful for him to handle, and forfeits the fight to the astonishment
                    of everyone else. Goku proclaims that Gohan will be able to defeat Cell. Though initially
                    outclassed, Gohan is eventually able to tap into his latent power and achieves the Super Saiyan 2
                    transformation. Refusing to accept defeat, Cell prepares to self-destruct and destroy the Earth.
                    <br>
                    Goku uses his Instant Transmission ability to teleport himself and Cell to King Kai's planet, where
                    Cell explodes and kills everyone there. However, Cell survives the blast and returns to Earth more
                    powerful than ever, where he promptly murders Trunks, but Gohan unleashes the totality of his power
                    in a massive Kamehameha wave and obliterates Cell for good.
                    <br>
                    The Dragon Balls are then used to revive everyone that was killed by Cell, while Goku chooses to
                    remain in the afterlife, refusing an offer by his friends to use the Namekian Dragon Balls to bring
                    him back. Trunks returns to his own timeline and uses his bolstered power to finally slay the Future
                    Androids and Cell.

                    Majin Buu Saga
                    <br>
                    Seven years later, Goku is revived for one day to reunite with his loved ones and meet his youngest
                    son, Goten, at the Tenkaichi Budōkai (天下一武道会, "Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts
                    Tournament"). Soon after, Goku and his allies are drawn into a fight by the Supreme Kai against a
                    magical being named Majin Buu (魔人ブウ, ”Demon Person Buu”) summoned by the evil wizard Babidi. After
                    numerous battles that result in the deaths of many of Goku's allies as well as the destruction of
                    Earth, Goku (whose life is fully restored by the Elder Supreme Kai) kills Kid Buu (the original form
                    of Majin Buu) with a Spirit Bomb attack containing the energy of all the inhabitants of Earth, who
                    were resurrected along with the planet by the Namekian Dragon Balls. Goku makes a wish for Buu to be
                    reincarnated as a good person and ten years later, at another Tenkaichi Budōkai, he meets Buu's
                    human reincarnation, Uub. Leaving the match between them unfinished, Goku departs with Uub to train
                    him to become Earth's new defender.
